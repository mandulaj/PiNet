~~The shame of my life XD~~

~~This is the Apache setup I used for the robot project. Under any circumstance do **NOT** clone. You may never know what will happen to your computerâ€¦.~~

####Not anymore!! I removed the ugly PHP, added some Node.js and voila!

Today I am older, smarter and have a larger field of view on what technology is out there.
Doing this project today I would most probably use node.js. Yet it was great experience; using PHP for the last time in my life :D
