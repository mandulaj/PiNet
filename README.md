PiNet
=========

Partially intelligent autonomic self learning artificial intelligence

~~The shame of my life XD~~

~~This is the Apache setup I used for the robot project. Under any circumstance do **NOT** clone. You may never know what will happen to your computer….~~

####Not anymore!! I removed the ugly PHP, added some Node.js and voila!

Today I am older, smarter and have a larger field of view on what technology is out there.
Doing this project today I would most probably use node.js. Yet it was great experience; using PHP for the last time in my life :D


###Feel free to fork & clone!
####More stuff is yet to come!


##About
This is a school project. As a part of the curriculum of the school, each student has to make a so called
"Personal project". It can be anything. I decided to try and make a robot. It will be controlled over the network
using WiFi but I also want to give it some intelligence. I am using OpenCV to do the vision, node to do the networking
and python to control the GPIO ports on my Raspberry Pi. I am looking forward to completing the project. Most of the
files I am not going to be posting on GitHub. This is only an experiment.

##Do You also want a PiNet in your home?
Do you want to try and build your own Pi-bot? I encourage you to do so. I learned a lot from playing with the Raspberry Pi whether it had to do with the project or not. You can use my program as a hint/help however I encourage you to rather invent it on your own. Not only will you understand how and why thing work the way they do but also I am not a programing genius and I am sure people will find ways to improve my code. Why not you be one of them? Building a robot with the modern technology available for us today is really a piece of cake. Donât be scared of by the ugly wires and electronic parts. If you are willing to invest some of your time (and money), you will find that everything is logical plus people will think YOU ARE A GENIUS!!! Me being you would not hesitate and GO FOR IT. The best feeling is when you can say **It's alive**
